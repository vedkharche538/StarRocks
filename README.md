# StarRocks
- Listed a ways how to setup the starrocks with differenent approaches.

I have tried different approaches and i have listed below the tried apporaches and will update in this repo in detail steps how you can utilize it.
First of all what is starrocks? StarRocks is an open-source, columnar database that enables real-time analytics.  It's designed to handle large amounts of data quickly and easily.

## 1. StarRocks Querying External Data via Hive Metastore
### Overview
This approach enables StarRocks to query existing S3 data by integrating with a Hive metastore for metadata management. It’s designed for scenarios where data already exists on S3 and doesn’t need to be duplicated into StarRocks.
### How It Works
- **Data Storage**: Data resides on S3 in formats like Parquet, ORC, or CSV.
- **Metadata Management**: Hive metastore maintains table schemas, partitions, and metadata.
- **External Catalog**: Create a catalog in StarRocks that connects to the Hive metastore.
- **Query Execution**: StarRocks queries the external tables directly through the Hive catalog.
### Advantages
- **Pipeline Compatibility**: Works with existing systems writing to S3 and updating Hive, minimizing disruption.
- **No Data Duplication**: Queries data in its original location, avoiding redundancy.
- **Broad Data Access**: Enables querying both new and historical S3 data.

### Limitations
- **Performance Trade-Off**: Slightly slower queries compared to the shared-data approach, as StarRocks doesn’t control data layout.
- **Additional Maintenance**: Requires managing a separate Hive metastore.





## 2. StarRocks Querying External Data via AWS Glue Data Catalog
### Overview
This method uses AWS Glue Data Catalog as a managed metadata service, allowing StarRocks to query S3 data without the overhead of maintaining a separate metastore like Hive.

### How It Works
- **Data Storage**: Data is stored on S3 in formats such as Parquet or ORC.
- **Metadata Management**: AWS Glue crawls S3 to populate its Data Catalog with table metadata.
- **External Catalog**: Configure a StarRocks catalog to connect to AWS Glue.
- **Query Execution**: StarRocks queries the S3 data via the Glue catalog.

### Advantages
- **Managed Solution**: AWS Glue reduces the operational burden of metadata management.
- **AWS Ecosystem Fit**: Integrates smoothly with services like Glue ETL and Athena.
- **In-Place Querying**: No need to move or replicate data.

### Limitations
- **Performance Considerations**: Similar to Hive, query speed may lag behind the shared-data approach.
- **Partition Constraints**: Glue’s limit of 100,000 partitions per table may restrict very large datasets.




## 3. StarRocks with Hudi Integration

### Overview
This approach incorporates Apache Hudi to bring advanced data management features like upserts, deletes, and time travel to StarRocks, querying Hudi formatted data stored on S3 with Hive Metastore.

### How It Works
- **Data Storage**: Data is written to S3 in Hudi format.
- **Metadata Management**: Managed by Hive metastore or AWS Glue for Hudi tables.
- **Hudi Catalog**: Set up a Hudi catalog in StarRocks to connect to the metastore.
- **Query Execution**: StarRocks queries Hudi tables via Hive Metastore.

### Advantages
- **Sophisticated Data Handling**: Supports updates, deletes, and incremental queries at the record level.
- **Historical Queries**: Enables time travel to access past data versions.
- **Versatility**: Adapts to dynamic data needs.

### Limitations
- **Setup Complexity**: More intricate to configure than simpler formats like Parquet.
- **Performance Cost**: Hudi’s advanced features may slow down read-heavy workloads.


## 5. StarRocks Shared-Data Approach

### Overview
The shared-data approach leverages StarRocks to fully manage both data and metadata, storing the data directly on AWS S3. This method involves configuring StarRocks to use an S3 bucket as its storage backend, making it a self-contained solution for data ingestion and querying.

### How It Works
- **Storage Volume Setup**: Configure a storage volume in StarRocks linked to an S3 bucket using IAM roles or access keys.
- **Table Creation**: Define tables with the property `"storage_volume" = "s3_volume_name"`, ensuring data resides on S3.
- **Data Ingestion Options**:
  - **Stream Load**: Batch ingestion from local files or streams. (considered it based on our usecase)
  - **Broker Load**: Load data from external sources like S3.
  - **Routine Load**: Continuous ingestion from systems like Apache Kafka.
- **Query Execution**: StarRocks executes queries directly on the S3-stored data, leveraging its own optimizations.

### Advantages
- **High Query Performance**: StarRocks optimizes data layout, partitioning, and indexing on S3, resulting in fast query execution.
- **Simplified Management**: No external metastore is required; StarRocks handles all aspects of data management.
- **Feature Integration**: Seamless use of StarRocks’ advanced features like caching and indexing.

### Limitations
- **Ingestion Dependency**: All data must flow through StarRocks’ ingestion mechanisms, potentially requiring pipeline adjustments.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Not suited for querying pre-existing S3 data without importing it into StarRocks first.
